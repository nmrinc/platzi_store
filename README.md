## Jest

Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

## enzyme

Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to test your React Components' output. You can also manipulate, traverse, and in some ways simulate runtime given the output.

## enzyme React adapter

It changes depending on the version of React you're using.
It's needed to use React configurations on tests.

## react-test-renderer

This package provides an experimental React renderer that can be used to render React components to pure JavaScript objects, without depending on the DOM or a native mobile environment.

Essentially, this package makes it easy to grab a snapshot of the "DOM tree" rendered by a React DOM or React Native component without using a browser or jsdom.
